            <h3>Never lose hope. Always chase <span class="cornblue">your dream</span> for success.</h3>
            <p>Always do what you wanna do. Do what ever makes you happy. If you find peace in your work. That work will
                be perfect for you. Never force yourself for anything. If you do that maybe the work might be fine but
                not you. Sometime its okey to be selfish.</p>
